    "An essential part of getting the robot to behave correctly around street lights is for it to know its distance to the light. On actual roads in Switzerland and many other countries, at every light there is a stop line painted on the road. We do the same in our context and thus the distance to the street light is equivalent to the distance to the stop line on the road."
